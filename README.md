# Data Visualization Project

## Data

For my final project I intend to create a US election visualization dashboard, loaded with data from several recent presidential elections and allowing users to create their own hypothetical "what if?" scenarios.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * What impact would, for example, a flipped state have on a federal election?
 * What patterns can be extrapolated from election data relative to various demographic parameters?

## Sketches

This sketch shows the main intended view of my viz. (Admittedly, not great artwork - that's why I have computers do it for me.) Users will be able to hover over a state and adjust hypothetical election scenarios, as well as viewing demographic data about each state and loading data from elections likely dating back to around 2000. A second view will allow users to see more detailed demographic information about a state, as well as its electoral history.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a [proof of concept visualization](https://vizhub.com/IanCoolidge0/758647f837c84e07894da40183b520fb) as part of a previous assignment that shows statewide election data for the 2020 election.

## Open Questions

The New York Times and FiveThirtyEight have made probably thousands of such visualizations at this point! Throughout the project I'll be looking at what I want to accomplish to stand out and create unique insights that don't typically appear in election visualizations.

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
