# Data Visualization Project

## Data

For my final project I intend to create a US election visualization dashboard, loaded with data from several recent presidential elections and allowing users to create their own hypothetical "what if?" scenarios.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * What impact would, for example, a flipped state have on a federal election?
 * What patterns can be extrapolated from election data relative to various demographic parameters?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)


## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization as part of a previous assignment that shows statewide election data for the 2020 election.

## Open Questions

The New York Times and FiveThirtyEight have made probably thousands of such visualizations at this point! Throughout the project I'll be looking at what I want to accomplish to stand out and create unique insights that don't typically appear in election visualizations.

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
